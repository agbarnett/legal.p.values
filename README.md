# legal.p.values

Rmarkdown file and data sets needed to reproduce my analysis of how p-values have been interpreted in US legal cases.

The data in `Comments.RData` (R format) and `Comments.txt` (tab-delimited) are the key results that give:
* the case number
* whether the interpretation was correct
* if it was incorrect, the type of mistake that was made
* additional comments
